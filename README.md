# Deploy Iris Model with Streamlit

This project demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model using Streamlit, a powerful tool for creating user interfaces without requiring extensive coding. The application is built using the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html) and a [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests-and-other-randomized-tree-ensembles).

## Overview

Streamlit offers a simple and effective solution for creating user-friendly interfaces for machine learning models, making it ideal for customers who require an easy-to-use, code-free environment.

To enhance the front-end of your application, explore the official [Streamlit API reference](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference), which provides a comprehensive guide to the various methods and features available in Streamlit.

## Disclaimer

**Important:** Uploading `.joblib files` (or other serialized model files) and datasets like `.csv` files directly to GitHub is generally considered a bad practice due to security risks and repository size concerns. In a production environment, it's recommended to store these files in a secure, dedicated storage solution (e.g., cloud storage services). However, for the sake of simplicity and to ensure that everyone can easily replicate this tutorial, the necessary `.joblib` and `.csv` files have been included in this repository.
